    "# An Introduction to the Black-Litterman in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Background and Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Litterman asset allocation model \\cite{black1992global}, \\cite{he1999intuition} provides a methodical way of combining an investors subjective views of the future performance of a risky investment asset with the views implied by the market equilibrium. The method has seen wide acceptance amongst practitioners as well as academics in spite of the fact that it originated as an internal Goldman Sachs working paper, rather than as a piece of research from academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black Litterman procedure can be viewed as a bayesian shrinkage method, that shrinks the expected returns constructed from an investor's views on asset returns towards asset returns implied by the market equilibrium. The procedure computes a set of expected returns that uses the market equilibrium implied  as a prior. This is then combined with returns implied by subjective investor views to produce a set of posterior expected returns $\\mu^{BL}$ and covariances $\\Sigma^{BL}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the obvious attraction of being able to incorporate subjective investor views, the Black-Litterman procedure has a second feature that makes it extremely attractive to portfolio optimization. It is well known that the Markowitz optimization procedure is highly sensitive to estimation errors in Expected Returns and Covariances, and this _error maximizing_ nature of the Markowitz procedure causes unstable portfolios with extreme weights that diverge rapidly from the market equilibrium portfolio even with minor changes to the inputs (e.g. \\cite{chopra1993effect}, \\cite{michaud1989markowitz}). However, the posterior parameters $\\mu^{BL}, \\Sigma^{BL}$ computed by the Black Litterman procedure are derived in part from the market portfolio, and therefore are much more pragmatic inputs for purposes of portfolio optimization. Specifically, when $\\mu^{BL}, \\Sigma^{BL}$ as used as as inputs to a Markowitz Optimizer, they produce optimized weights that diverge from the market portfolio in limited ways, and only to the extent of the confidence that the investor expresses in the views. Consequently the optimized portfolios are more stable portfolios than with pure Markowitz optimization with sample estimates. In the extreme, with appropriately set parameters, the Markowitz portfolio computed from the Black-Litterman parameters when there are no subjective investor views exactly coincides and is able to recover the market equilibrium portfolio."

    "### The Black Litterman Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have $N$ assets, and $K$ views. There are two sets of inputs to the procedure. The first set of inputs relate to market parameters and these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "w & \\mbox{A Column Vector ($N \\times 1$) of Equilibrium Market Weights of the Assets} \\\\\n",
    "\\Sigma & \\mbox{A Covariance Matrix ($N \\times N$) of the Assets} \\\\\n",
    "R_f & \\mbox{The Risk Free Rate} \\\\\n",
    "\\delta & \\mbox{The investor's Risk Aversion parameter}  \\\\\n",
    "\\tau & \\mbox{A scalar indicating the uncertainty of the prior (details below)}\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these parameters can be inferred from other parameters if they are not explicitly specified. For instance, the risk aversion parameter can be set arbitrarily. For instance, some authors use $\\delta = 2.5$ while others use the value of $\\delta = 2.14$ in order to be consistent with the value calculated in \\cite{dimson2008triumph}.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\cite{beach2007application} suggest using $2.65$. Another common approach is to set $\\delta$ to the Market Price of Risk (i.e. a measure of the risk aversion of the Representative Investor, which is computed as $\\delta = \\mu_M/\\sigma^2_M$ where $\\mu_M$ and $\\sigma^2_M$ are estimates of the mean and variance of the returns of the market portfolio. Frequently, a broad market index such as the S\\&P500 is taken as a proxy for the market in order to compute the market price of risk from $\\mu_M$ and $\\sigma^2_M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment of $\\tau$ is the source of some confusion. As we will explain in the following section, some implementors have done away with $\\tau$ by setting it to $1$ or to calibrate the model to $tau$. In the original model, Black and Litterman suggest using a small number. A common technique is to set $\\tau = 1/T$ where $T$ is the number of periods of data used. Thus, for $T=5$ you would use $1/(5 \\times 12)$ which yields a value of approximately $\\tau=.02$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second set of inputs that the procedure needs is a representation of the investors views. These are specified via:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "Q & \\mbox{An $K \\times 1$ ``Qualitative Views'' or simply, Views matrix} \\\\\n",
    "P & \\mbox{A $K \\times N$ ``Projection'' or ``Pick'' matrix, linking each view to the assets} \\\\\n",
    "\\Omega & \\mbox{A Covariance matrix representing the uncertainty of views}\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are represented in $Q$ and $P$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the $k$-th view is an absolute view, it is represented by setting $Q_k$ to the expected return of asset $k$ and setting $P_{ki}$ to 1 and all other elements of row $k$ in $P$ to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the $k$-th view is an relative view, between assets $i$ and $j$ it is represented by setting $Q_k$ to the expected difference of returns between assets $i$ and $j$, and setting $P_{ki}$ to $-1$ for the underperforming asset, $P_{kj}$ to $+1$ and all other elements of row $k$ in $P$ to zero. $\\Omega$ is either set to the specified uncertainty or is inferred from the user or from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty of the views $\\Omega$ is either set by the user, or inferred (e.g. via statements of confidence, from market data, from the variance of residuals from a prediction model used to generate the views etc, we shall see examples in sections below). In particular, \\cite{he1999intuition} suggest setting it to be the diagonal matrix obtained from the diagonal elements of $P \\tau \\Sigma P^T$, which is what we shall do for some of our initial tests. In my implementation the code accepts a matrix, but uses this assumption as the default if the user does not specify a matrix to use as $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Master Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the procedure is a _reverse-optimization_ step that infers the implied returns vector $\\pi$ that are implied by the equilibrium weights $w$ using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi = \\delta\\Sigma w$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the posterior returns and covariances are obtained from the _Black-Litterman Master Formula_ which is the following set of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{eq:blMuOrig}\n",
    "\\mu^{BL} = [(\\tau\\Sigma)^{-1} + P \\Omega^{-1} P]^{-1}[(\\tau\\Sigma)^{-1} \\pi + P \\Omega^{-1} Q]\n",

    "#### Inverting $\\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "While the master formulas identified in Equation \\ref{eq:blMuOrig} and Equation \\ref{eq:blSigmaOrig} are frequently easy to implement, they do involve the term $\\Omega^{-1}$. Unfortuantely, $\\Omega$ is sometimes non-invertible, which poses difficulties to implement the equations as-is. Fortunately the equations are easily transformed to a form that does not require this troublesome inversion. Therefore, frequently, implementations use the following equivalent versions of these equations which are sometimes computationally more stable, since they do not involve inverting $\\Omega$. Derivations of these alternate forms are provided in the appendices of \\cite{walters2011black}:\n",

    "### Flavors of Black-Litterman\n",
    "\n",
    "The original method described above has also seen a number of modifications and extensions (e.g. see \\cite{walters2011black} for an extensive and detailed summary) to the point where there is some confusion about exactly what comprises the true _Black-Litterman_ model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shall use a nomenclature that is consistent with \\cite{walters2011black}. Walters classifies implementations in two broad categories. The first category was implemented by \\cite{black1992global} and \\cite{he1999intuition}, and Walters refers to these as the _Reference Model_. The second category consists of well known implementations described in \\cite{satchell2000demystification} and a series of papers by Meucci (e.g. \\cite{meucci2005beyond}, \\cite{meucci2009enhancing}, \\cite{meucci2012fully}). In these models, the $\\tau$ parameter is eliminated, either by setting it to 1 or by incorporating it into the $\\Omega$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this document, I shall be restricting myself to the _Reference Model_ as originally described in \\cite{black1992global} and \\cite{he1999intuition}, and I shall not be implementing the extensions of Meucci and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook proceeds as follows. In the following section, I shall implement the Black Litterman procedure in Python and annotate the code as I proceed, to illustrate each step. I then use the code to exactly reproduce the results in \\cite{he1999intuition}.\n",
    " \n",
    "Having established that the code accurately implements the Black Litterman procedure, I shall get down apply the procedure to the Fama French 6-portfolio allocation problem. Along the way, my tests will impose absolute views as well as relative views, and test the impact of the procedure on portfolios using a range of Seven different prediction strategies to obtain views. I also backtest these strategies over time and examine various portfolio metrics, while comparing the Black Litterman derived (BL) expected returns being supplied to an optimizer with weights obtained from Naive Mean-Variance optimization using expected returns and covariance matrixes directly from the prediction strategy. Finally, I conclude the section by examining the impact of these portfolios on transaction costs. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Black Litterman procedure is implemented in Python in the function `bl`. Before we implement the body of `bl`, let's build a few helper functions that will hopefully make the code a bit easier to understand and deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy treats a column vector differently from a 1 dimensional array. In order to consistently use column vectors, the following helper function takes either a numpy array or a numpy one-column matrix (i.e. a column vector) and returns the data as a column vector. Let's call this function `as_colvec`\n"
